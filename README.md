## Problem Statement
This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MySQL, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

### Objectives:
1. **MySQL Connection and Data Retrieval:** Establish a connection to the MySQL database, retrieve the Airbnb dataset, and ensure efficient data retrieval for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Clean and prepare the dataset by addressing missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.
3. **Streamlit Web Application:** Develop a web application with interactive maps showcasing the distribution of Airbnb listings, allowing users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.
4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:** Analyze pricing variations based on location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.
5. **Availability Analysis by Season:** Visualize occupancy rates and demand fluctuations across seasons using suitable visualizations.
6. **Location-Based Insights:** Extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods to investigate location-based trends.
7. **Interactive Visualizations:** Enable users to filter and drill down into the data through dynamic visualizations.
8. **Dashboard Creation:** Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, presenting key insights from the analysis.

## Data
### MySQL Setup:
1. **Create a MySQL Database:** Set up a MySQL database to store the Airbnb dataset.
2. **Import the Airbnb Dataset:** Import the dataset into your MySQL database, ensuring proper indexing and data integrity.

## Approach:
1. **MySQL Connection and Data Retrieval:** Establish a connection to the MySQL database and retrieve the Airbnb dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Clean the dataset, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types as necessary.
3. **Geospatial Visualization:** Use the geospatial data from the Airbnb dataset to create interactive maps in Streamlit, visualizing the distribution of listings.
4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:** Analyze and visualize pricing trends across locations, property types, and seasons.
5. **Availability Analysis by Season:** Visualize occupancy rates, booking patterns, and demand fluctuations throughout the year.
6. **Location-Based Insights:** Use MySQL queries to extract and visualize data for specific regions or neighborhoods.
7. **Interactive Visualizations:** Develop dynamic visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data.
8. **Dashboard Creation:** Use Tableau or Power BI to create a comprehensive dashboard presenting the key insights.
